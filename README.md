## UX

<a name="ux"></a>
### Pre-project planning
When choosing a project I thought of things that I am interested in and passionate about. This has led be to drifting as there aren't a lot of websites like this for Irish drifting specifically.

I then researched different websites which contain information on Irish drifting, events and drivers:
- https://www.irishdriftchampionship.com/
- https://dm.gp/
- https://shop.driftgames.life/ 
- https://www.lzworldtour.com/ 
- https://www.juiceboxforyou.com/

This has led me to the conclusion that while there is a lot of information out there, it takes some time to scroll through all the websites and find the information you're after. Therefore I decided to build a website which hosts all relevant information in one place.

## UX Design

### To identify the best way forward for my project, I started looking at the user and business requirements for this type of website

## User Stories
> As a new user I want to learn what is drifting

> As a user I want to find event calendar

> As a user I want to learn about drivers

> As a user I want to be able to get newsletters

## Owner
> As an owner I want to inform about drifting

> As an owner I want to share event details

> As an owner I want to share driver bio

> As an owner I want to share updates about events and drivers

## Scope Plane
> Website should have consistent navigation pane across all devices

> Website should have a hero message so the users understand what the website is about

> Website should detail information about drifting, it's origins and drifting in Ireland

> Website should contain event calendar

> Website should contain Irish driver details

> Website should contain newsletter sign uo option

## Structure Plane
> Website will contain 4 pages: Home, Events, Drivers, Sign Up

### Home Page

> Design of the website is meant to be simple and provide relevant information without any clutter. As I worked through the project, I had to change the design as it did not look how I wanted. I had to change the background and reorder the content.

> Initially I chose an image of a car as a background, however the image was bright in color which made it difficult to read text. When added in shading around text, the website did not look right. I opted for a dark charcoal color background with colours coming in from logo and images.

### Colours
> I decided that the best way forward will be to keep colours of text and background plain and simple with images providing colour.

> This also meant that with a dark background images had much more visual impact to the end user

#### Fonts

- Briem Hand
- Open Sans

#### Colours

> Text colour kept to a single colour. Logo and box shading colours used where taken from the logo colours to keep colouring to a minimum

- #FFFFFF
