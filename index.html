        <div id="what-is-drifting-origins">
            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p> Despite the popular belief that drifting originated in 1970s Japan, 
                this driving technique was first practiced in Europe before 1950. 
                Automotive icon Enzo Ferrari credits Italian driver Tazio Nuvolari 
                as being the inventor of the four-wheel drift. Later, British racing driver 
                Stirling Moss improved upon Nuvolari's technique, mastering the art of drifting 
                through curves in Formula 1 races by steering with the accelerator pedal. 
                More recently, drifting as a specialized competition became popular in Japan.
                It was most popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races.</p>

            <h3>Technical Bit</h3>
            <p> Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers,
                with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through 
                the entirety of a corner or a turn. The technique causes the rear slip angle
                to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels 
                are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left,
                wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering).</p>

            <h3>Roots in Ireland</h3>
            <p> Just like other countries, drifting started in Ireland as a predominantly grassroots affair. 
                You drove your car to the event, and you drove it home. Skill levels were relatively low 
                in hindsight, but that didnâ€™t deter anyone. Within the first three seasons, 
                drivers had advanced rapidly, as had the preparation of their cars. Taking inspiration from Japan, 
                courtesy of Video Option DVDs of dubious originality and low resolution video online 
                these were pre-YouTube days the stakes and standards rose. In 2005, the arrival of two Japanese 
                drivers in Ireland was the catalyst for the sport to absolutely explode in popularity.

                As early as 2007, the Irish Drifting Championship (then Prodrift Series) was televised nationally.
                It was becoming a lucrative sport as sponsors and tuning shops all fought for their share of the limelight.
                It was also around this time that a young kid entered the pro ranks.</p>
